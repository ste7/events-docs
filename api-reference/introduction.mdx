## Welcome

This REST API allows you to programmatically manage and interact with your Novacal account and its related data. All endpoints require authentication using Bearer tokens and return responses in JSON format.

Use this API to integrate Novacal's scheduling capabilities into your applications, automate event management, and build custom scheduling workflows.

## Authentication

All API endpoints are authenticated using Bearer tokens and picked up from the specification file.

### Getting Your API Key

To generate and manage your API keys, visit the [API Keys settings page](https://app.novacal.io/settings/api-keys) in your Novacal account. You can create new API keys or manage existing ones from this page.

### Using Your API Key

Include your API key in the `Authorization` header of each request using the Bearer token format:

```
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```

Example request:

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     https://api.novacal.io/v1/endpoint
```
